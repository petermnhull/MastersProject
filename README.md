# Masters Project

Adaptation of an existing single filament model for modelling a two-dimensional microswimmer axoneme. The axoneme is comprised of two Kirchhoff filaments inter-connected through a series of cross-links that generate internal driving forces for movement. The code is set up for easy use so that multiple swimmers with different behaviours can be simulated.

The code uses the method described [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12609) for modelling a single kirchhoff filament falling under gravity. It uses the EJBb version of Broyden's method with a reduced system of nonlinear equations. For solving the hydrodynamic forces it uses the RPY tensor.

The thesis containing the background and extensive detailing of the axoneme model is also available for viewing.
